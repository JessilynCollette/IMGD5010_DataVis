# Overview
This project is a p5.js visualization of some JSON data about Animal Crossing characters. The variables I used from the dataset include a characters Name, Birthday Month, and Personality type. 

## Concept
This code creates a spherical visualization of JSON data about Animal Crossing characters. Represented in a spherical shape are smaller circles with the names of some animal crossing characters (the number can be changed using the numCircles variable in the code). Animal Crossing characters that have the same personality type (e.g. "Cranky" or "Peppy") are connected using Blue lines. Animal Crossing characters that share the same Birthday Month are connected by Green lines.

## Goal / Inspiration
My goal was to create a type of artwork from visualizing data. I was inspired by visualizations from Michelle Chandra: https://www.michellechandra.com/category/data-visualization/page/2/
